# Suskibirds Detector

This is an Android application that detects the freshness of bananas using a deep learning model and computer vision. The model is based on transfer learning with YOLOv8 and has been trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## Download

The application can be downloaded from the following link:

[Download Suskibirds Detector APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nAx90cRNW7uFl48LB5bPSi6P9lzhuodu/view?usp=sharing)

## Features

- Detects the freshness of bananas in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a freshness score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consists of 837 images with 3 classes. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:

## Model Training

The model was trained using transfer learning with YOLOv8 on a custom dataset from Roboflow. Once trained, the custom YOLOv8 model was converted to TensorFlow Lite for deployment on Android.

## Result

    "train_batch0" refers to the first batch of training data used in the training phase of a machine learning or deep learning model. It contains the initial subset of the training data, which the model processes to begin updating its parameters and improving performance.
