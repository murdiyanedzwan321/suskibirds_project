# Suskibirds Detector

This is an Android application that detects the freshness of bananas using a deep learning model and computer vision. The model is based on transfer learning with YOLOv8 and has been trained on a custom dataset from Roboflow.

## Download

The application can be downloaded from the following link:

## Features

- Detects the freshness of bananas in real-time using the camera.
- Provides a freshness score to help users make informed decisions.
- Easy-to-use interface with clear instructions.

## Dataset

The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consists of 837 images with 3 classes. The dataset can be accessed from the following link:
